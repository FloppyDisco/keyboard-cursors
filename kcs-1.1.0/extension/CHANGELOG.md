### 1.1.0 (08 Aug 2023)

-  When you you place an inactive selection over another, it will only remove the existing one and not place a new one. The reason for this change is to have a universal behaviour. We already had this behaviour when you perfectly matched an inactive selection. But now you'll know what to expect in each situation when an inactive selection is placed over another in any way, it will only remove the existing one.

-  When the inactive selections are activated and then discarded, the selection which remains is the one whose inactive selection was placed first. This behaviour is in accordance with how VS Code handles this when you place multiple selections with the mouse and then discard them.
