-  **Experimental: Inactive cursors and selections react to document edits**

   When you make edits to the document, the inacitve cursors and selections will move across the document in accordance with those edits.

   ![Inactive cursors and selections react to document edits](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExNXd0ZGRkNGZkcjMzZjM0aXQ1dWNxam54azQ1dDZ2d256MDFrb2wzZSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/SXNRBjr7H1cWx2yPYY/giphy.gif)

   This feature is also integrated with the Undo-Redo system, meaning that the undone or redone inactive cursors and selections will respect the new document edits.

   By default this feature is enabled. If you wish to disable this, it is found in VS Code Settings under the name `Kcs: Inactive Selections React To Document Edits`.

   Please report any issues you have about this experimental feature.

-  **You can change the colors of the inactive cursors and selections**

   1. Open the Command Palette (Windows/Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+P`, Mac: `Cmd+Shift+P`).

   2. Search for and select `Preferences: Open Settingts (UI)`.

   3. Once the settings view is open, type "keyboardCursor" and options like `Kcs: Cursor Color` and `Kcs: Selection Color` will appear. Their value has to be given in hex code.

   <br>

   -  For developers who want to change these colors through their theme, this is an example of how you could do it:
      ```javascript
      const configuration = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('keyboardCursor')
      await configuration.update('cursorColor', '#ff0000', vscode.ConfigurationTarget.Global)
      await configuration.update('selectionColor', '#ff000099', vscode.ConfigurationTarget.Global)
      ```
      Note that you can use transparency, especially for the selection color.

### Extension limitations

These extension's limitations are derived from the limitations of the VS Code Extension API itself, but they are handled to minimize as much as possible their inconvenience.
