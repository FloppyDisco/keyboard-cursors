### Everything is done with two commands

-  What you see in the first gif is done with `Place Inactive Selection` command.

-  What you see in the second gif is done with `Activate Selections` command.

-  By default they are mapped to `Page Down` and `Page Up` respectively. If you need help in remapping them, check below.

### Feedback

-  For questions, suggestions, issues, feel free to use the Issues section of the extension's repository: [Issues](https://github.com/srares13/keyboard-cursors-and-selections/issues).

### Notes

-  A cursor is actually just a selection which has the start and the end positions the same. This is useful to know further that when saying "selections" I'm including also the cursors.

### Other features

-  To remove all inactive selections, simply press `Esc`.

-  To remove a certain inactive selection, select it and use again the `Place Inactive Selection` command.

-  If you activated the inactive selections, did not yet edit the document and discarded the active selections, the inactive selections will reappear. This is because maybe you wanted to modify something about those inactive selections, and this behaviour allows you to do that.

### If you want to remap the commands

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` - Windows, `Cmd+Shift+P` - Mac).

2. Search for and select `Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts`.

3. Once the Shortcuts tab is open, search for the desired command, in this case `Place Inactive Selection` or `Activate Selections`, double click on it and press the new key combination.
